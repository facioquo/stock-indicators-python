# Markers for non-standard test categories
markers =
    localization: tests for non-English locales environments
    performance: tests for performance benchmarks
    perf_focus: focused performance subset for rapid iteration

# Default: allows `pytest` to run all tests
# except those marked as `localization` or `performance`
addopts = -m "not localization and not performance"
