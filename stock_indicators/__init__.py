Stock Indicators for Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stock Indicators for Python is a library that produces financial
market technical indicators. Send in historical price quotes and
get back desired indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength
Index, Stochastic Oscillator, Parabolic SAR, etc. Nothing more.

It can be used in any market analysis software using standard OHLCV
price quotes for equities, commodities, forex, cryptocurrencies,
and others. We had private trading algorithms, machine learning,
and charting systems in mind when originally creating this community
library. A Stock Indicators for .NET is also available.
